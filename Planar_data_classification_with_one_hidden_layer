Planar data classification with one hidden layer
Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment! It's time to build your first neural network, which will have one hidden layer. Now, you'll notice a big difference between this model and the one you implemented previously using logistic regression.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
Compute the cross entropy loss
Implement forward and backward propagation

1 - Packages
First import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.

numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
sklearn provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
matplotlib is a library for plotting graphs in Python.
testCases provides some test examples to assess the correctness of your functions
planar_utils provide various useful functions used in this assignment
# Package imports
import numpy as np
import copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from testCases_v2 import *
from public_tests import *
import sklearn
import sklearn.datasets
import sklearn.linear_model
from planar_utils import plot_decision_boundary, sigmoid, load_planar_dataset, load_extra_datasets
​
%matplotlib inline
​
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

2 - Load the Dataset
X, Y = load_planar_dataset()
Visualize the dataset using matplotlib. The data looks like a "flower" with some red (label y=0) and some blue (y=1) points. Your goal is to build a model to fit this data. In other words, we want the classifier to define regions as either red or blue.

# Visualize the data:
plt.scatter(X[0, :], X[1, :], c=Y, s=40, cmap=plt.cm.Spectral);
You have:

- a numpy-array (matrix) X that contains your features (x1, x2)
- a numpy-array (vector) Y that contains your labels (red:0, blue:1).
First, get a better sense of what your data is like.


Exercise 1
How many training examples do you have? In addition, what is the shape of the variables X and Y?

Hint: How do you get the shape of a numpy array? (help)

# (≈ 3 lines of code)
# shape_X = ...
# shape_Y = ...
# training set size
# m = ...
# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
​
​
# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
​
print ('The shape of X is: ' + str(shape_X))
print ('The shape of Y is: ' + str(shape_Y))
print ('I have m = %d training examples!' % (m))
Expected Output:

shape of X	(2, 400)
shape of Y	(1, 400)
m	400

3 - Simple Logistic Regression
Before building a full neural network, let's check how logistic regression performs on this problem. You can use sklearn's built-in functions for this. Run the code below to train a logistic regression classifier on the dataset.

# Train the logistic regression classifier
clf = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV();
clf.fit(X.T, Y.T);
You can now plot the decision boundary of these models! Run the code below.

# Plot the decision boundary for logistic regression
plot_decision_boundary(lambda x: clf.predict(x), X, Y)
plt.title("Logistic Regression")
​
# Print accuracy
LR_predictions = clf.predict(X.T)
print ('Accuracy of logistic regression: %d ' % float((np.dot(Y,LR_predictions) + np.dot(1-Y,1-LR_predictions))/float(Y.size)*100) +
       '% ' + "(percentage of correctly labelled datapoints)")
Expected Output:

Accuracy	47%
Interpretation: The dataset is not linearly separable, so logistic regression doesn't perform well. Hopefully a neural network will do better. Let's try this now!


4 - Neural Network model
Logistic regression didn't work well on the flower dataset. Next, you're going to train a Neural Network with a single hidden layer and see how that handles the same problem.

The model:

Mathematically:

For one example 𝑥(𝑖):
𝑧[1](𝑖)=𝑊[1]𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏[1](1)
𝑎[1](𝑖)=tanh(𝑧[1](𝑖))(2)
𝑧[2](𝑖)=𝑊[2]𝑎[1](𝑖)+𝑏[2](3)
𝑦̂ (𝑖)=𝑎[2](𝑖)=𝜎(𝑧[2](𝑖))(4)
𝑦(𝑖)𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛={10if 𝑎[2](𝑖)>0.5otherwise (5)
Given the predictions on all the examples, you can also compute the cost 𝐽 as follows:
𝐽=−1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚(𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑎[2](𝑖))+(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−𝑎[2](𝑖)))(6)
Reminder: The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:

1. Define the neural network structure ( # of input units,  # of hidden units, etc). 
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
    - Implement forward propagation
    - Compute loss
    - Implement backward propagation to get the gradients
    - Update parameters (gradient descent)
In practice, you'll often build helper functions to compute steps 1-3, then merge them into one function called nn_model(). Once you've built nn_model() and learned the right parameters, you can make predictions on new data.


4.1 - Defining the neural network structure

Exercise 2 - layer_sizes
Define three variables:

- n_x: the size of the input layer
- n_h: the size of the hidden layer (set this to 4) 
- n_y: the size of the output layer
Hint: Use shapes of X and Y to find n_x and n_y. Also, hard code the hidden layer size to be 4.

# GRADED FUNCTION: layer_sizes

Expected output

The size of the input layer is: n_x = 5

4.2 - Initialize the model's parameters

Exercise 3 - initialize_parameters
Implement the function initialize_parameters().

Instructions:

Make sure your parameters' sizes are right. Refer to the neural network figure above if needed.
You will initialize the weights matrices with random values.
Use: np.random.randn(a,b) * 0.01 to randomly initialize a matrix of shape (a,b).
You will initialize the bias vectors as zeros.
Use: np.zeros((a,b)) to initialize a matrix of shape (a,b) with zeros.

4.3 - The Loop

Exercise 4 - forward_propagation
Implement forward_propagation() using the following equations:

𝑍[1]=𝑊[1]𝑋+𝑏[1](1)
𝐴[1]=tanh(𝑍[1])(2)
𝑍[2]=𝑊[2]𝐴[1]+𝑏[2](3)
𝑌̂ =𝐴[2]=𝜎(𝑍[2])(4)
Instructions:

Check the mathematical representation of your classifier in the figure above.
Use the function sigmoid(). It's built into (imported) this notebook.
Use the function np.tanh(). It's part of the numpy library.
Implement using these steps:
Retrieve each parameter from the dictionary "parameters" (which is the output of initialize_parameters() by using parameters[".."].
Implement Forward Propagation. Compute 𝑍[1],𝐴[1],𝑍[2] and 𝐴[2] (the vector of all your predictions on all the examples in the training set).
Values needed in the backpropagation are stored in "cache". The cache will be given as an input to the backpropagation function.
# GRADED FUNCTION:forward_propagation
​
def forward_propagation(X, parameters):
    """
    Argument:
    X -- input data of size (n_x, m)
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters (output of initialization function)

    cache = {"Z1": Z1,
             "A1": A1,
             "Z2": Z2,
             "A2": A2}

​
forward_propagation_test(forward_propagation)
Expected output

A2 = [[0.21292656 0.21274673 0.21295976]]

4.4 - Compute the Cost
Now that you've computed 𝐴[2] (in the Python variable "A2"), which contains 𝑎[2](𝑖) for all examples, you can compute the cost function as follows:

𝐽=−1𝑚∑𝑖=1𝑚(𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑎[2](𝑖))+(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−𝑎[2](𝑖)))(13)

Exercise 5 - compute_cost
Implement compute_cost() to compute the value of the cost 𝐽.

Instructions:

There are many ways to implement the cross-entropy loss. This is one way to implement one part of the equation without for loops: −∑𝑖=1𝑚𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑎[2](𝑖)):

logprobs = np.multiply(np.log(A2),Y)
cost = - np.sum(logprobs)          
Use that to build the whole expression of the cost function.

Notes:

You can use either np.multiply() and then np.sum() or directly np.dot()).
If you use np.multiply followed by np.sum the end result will be a type float, whereas if you use np.dot, the result will be a 2D numpy array.
You can use np.squeeze() to remove redundant dimensions (in the case of single float, this will be reduced to a zero-dimension array).
You can also cast the array as a type float using float().
# GRADED FUNCTION: compute_cost

def compute_cost(A2, Y):

​

Expected output

4.5 - Implement Backpropagation
Using the cache computed during forward propagation, you can now implement backward propagation.


Exercise 6 - backward_propagation
Implement the function backward_propagation().

Instructions: Backpropagation is usually the hardest (most mathematical) part in deep learning. To help you, here again is the slide from the lecture on backpropagation. You'll want to use the six equations on the right of this slide, since you are building a vectorized implementation.


Figure 1: Backpropagation. Use the six equations on the right.
Tips:
To compute dZ1 you'll need to compute 𝑔[1]′(𝑍[1]). Since 𝑔[1](.) is the tanh activation function, if 𝑎=𝑔[1](𝑧) then 𝑔[1]′(𝑧)=1−𝑎2. So you can compute 𝑔[1]′(𝑍[1]) using (1 - np.power(A1, 2)).

4.6 - Update Parameters

Exercise 7 - update_parameters
Implement the update rule. Use gradient descent. You have to use (dW1, db1, dW2, db2) in order to update (W1, b1, W2, b2).

General gradient descent rule: 𝜃=𝜃−𝛼∂𝐽∂𝜃 where 𝛼 is the learning rate and 𝜃 represents a parameter.

Use copy.deepcopy(...) when copying lists or dictionaries that are passed as parameters to functions. It avoids input parameters being modified within the function. In some scenarios, this could be inefficient, but it is required for grading purposes.

5 - Test the Model

5.1 - Predict

Exercise 9 - predict
Predict with your model by building predict(). Use forward propagation to predict results.

Reminder: predictions = 𝑦𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=𝟙{activation > 0.5}={10if 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛>0.5otherwise

As an example, if you would like to set the entries of a matrix X to 0 and 1 based on a threshold you would do: X_new = (X > threshold)

# GRADED FUNCTION: predict
​
def predict(parameters, X):
    """
    Using the learned parameters, predicts a class for each example in X
    
    Arguments:
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters 
    X -- input data of size (n_x, m)
    
    Returns
    predictions -- vector of predictions of our model (red: 0 / blue: 1)
    """
    
    # Computes probabilities using forward propagation, and classifies to 0/1 using 0.5 as the threshold.
    #(≈ 2 lines of code)
    # A2, cache = ...
    # predictions = ...
    # YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
    
    
    # YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
    
    return predictions
parameters, t_X = predict_test_case()
​
predictions = predict(parameters, t_X)
print("Predictions: " + str(predictions))
​
predict_test(predict)
Expected output

Predictions: [[ True False  True]]

5.2 - Test the Model on the Planar Dataset
It's time to run the model and see how it performs on a planar dataset. Run the following code to test your model with a single hidden layer of 𝑛ℎ hidden units!

# Build a model with a n_h-dimensional hidden layer
parameters = nn_model(X, Y, n_h = 4, num_iterations = 10000, print_cost=True)
​
# Plot the decision boundary
plot_decision_boundary(lambda x: predict(parameters, x.T), X, Y)
plt.title("Decision Boundary for hidden layer size " + str(4))
# Print accuracy
predictions = predict(parameters, X)
print ('Accuracy: %d' % float((np.dot(Y, predictions.T) + np.dot(1 - Y, 1 - predictions.T)) / float(Y.size) * 100) + '%')
Expected Output:

Accuracy	90%
Accuracy is really high compared to Logistic Regression. The model has learned the patterns of the flower's petals! Unlike logistic regression, neural networks are able to learn even highly non-linear decision boundaries.

Congrats on finishing this Programming Assignment!
Here's a quick recap of all you just accomplished:

Built a complete 2-class classification neural network with a hidden layer
Made good use of a non-linear unit
Computed the cross entropy loss
Implemented forward and backward propagation
Seen the impact of varying the hidden layer size, including overfitting.
You've created a neural network that can learn patterns! Excellent work. Below, there are some optional exercises to try out some other hidden layer sizes, and other datasets.


6 - Tuning hidden layer size (optional/ungraded exercise)
Run the following code(it may take 1-2 minutes). Then, observe different behaviors of the model for various hidden layer sizes.

# This may take about 2 minutes to run
​
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 32))
hidden_layer_sizes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 50]
for i, n_h in enumerate(hidden_layer_sizes):
    plt.subplot(5, 2, i+1)
    plt.title('Hidden Layer of size %d' % n_h)
    parameters = nn_model(X, Y, n_h, num_iterations = 5000)
    plot_decision_boundary(lambda x: predict(parameters, x.T), X, Y)
    predictions = predict(parameters, X)
    accuracy = float((np.dot(Y,predictions.T) + np.dot(1 - Y, 1 - predictions.T)) / float(Y.size)*100)
    print ("Accuracy for {} hidden units: {} %".format(n_h, accuracy))
Interpretation:

The larger models (with more hidden units) are able to fit the training set better, until eventually the largest models overfit the data.
The best hidden layer size seems to be around n_h = 5. Indeed, a value around here seems to fits the data well without also incurring noticeable overfitting.
Later, you'll become familiar with regularization, which lets you use very large models (such as n_h = 50) without much overfitting.
Note: Remember to submit the assignment by clicking the blue "Submit Assignment" button at the upper-right.

Some optional/ungraded questions that you can explore if you wish:

What happens when you change the tanh activation for a sigmoid activation or a ReLU activation?
Play with the learning_rate. What happens?
What if we change the dataset? (See part 7 below!)

7- Performance on other datasets
If you want, you can rerun the whole notebook (minus the dataset part) for each of the following datasets.

# Datasets
noisy_circles, noisy_moons, blobs, gaussian_quantiles, no_structure = load_extra_datasets()
​
datasets = {"noisy_circles": noisy_circles,
            "noisy_moons": noisy_moons,
            "blobs": blobs,
            "gaussian_quantiles": gaussian_quantiles}
​
### START CODE HERE ### (choose your dataset)
dataset = "noisy_moons"
### END CODE HERE ###
​
X, Y = datasets[dataset]
X, Y = X.T, Y.reshape(1, Y.shape[0])
​
# make blobs binary
if dataset == "blobs":
    Y = Y%2
​
# Visualize the data
plt.scatter(X[0, :], X[1, :], c=Y, s=40, cmap=plt.cm.Spectral);
