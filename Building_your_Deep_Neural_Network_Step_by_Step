Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
Welcome to your week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! Previously you trained a 2-layer Neural Network with a single hidden layer. This week, you will build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want!

In this notebook, you'll implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
For the next assignment, you'll use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.
By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
Notation:

Superscript  [𝑙]  denotes a quantity associated with the  𝑙𝑡ℎ  layer.
Example:  𝑎[𝐿]  is the  𝐿𝑡ℎ  layer activation.  𝑊[𝐿]  and  𝑏[𝐿]  are the  𝐿𝑡ℎ  layer parameters.
Superscript  (𝑖)  denotes a quantity associated with the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  example.
Example:  𝑥(𝑖)  is the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  training example.
Lowerscript  𝑖  denotes the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  entry of a vector.
Example:  𝑎[𝑙]𝑖  denotes the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  entry of the  𝑙𝑡ℎ  layer's activations).
Let's get started!

2 - Outline
To build your neural network, you'll be implementing several "helper functions." These helper functions will be used in the next assignment to build a two-layer neural network and an L-layer neural network.

Each small helper function will have detailed instructions to walk you through the necessary steps. Here's an outline of the steps in this assignment:

Initialize the parameters for a two-layer network and for an 𝐿-layer neural network
Implement the forward propagation module (shown in purple in the figure below)
Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step (resulting in 𝑍[𝑙]).
The ACTIVATION function is provided for you (relu/sigmoid)
Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] forward function.
Stack the [LINEAR->RELU] forward function L-1 time (for layers 1 through L-1) and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer 𝐿). This gives you a new L_model_forward function.
Compute the loss
Implement the backward propagation module (denoted in red in the figure below)
Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's backward propagation step
The gradient of the ACTIVATE function is provided for you(relu_backward/sigmoid_backward)
Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] backward function
Stack [LINEAR->RELU] backward L-1 times and add [LINEAR->SIGMOID] backward in a new L_model_backward function
Finally, update the parameters

Figure 1

Note:

For every forward function, there is a corresponding backward function. This is why at every step of your forward module you will be storing some values in a cache. These cached values are useful for computing gradients.

In the backpropagation module, you can then use the cache to calculate the gradients. Don't worry, this assignment will show you exactly how to carry out each of these steps!


3 - Initialization
You will write two helper functions to initialize the parameters for your model. The first function will be used to initialize parameters for a two layer model. The second one generalizes this initialization process to 𝐿 layers.


3.1 - 2-layer Neural Network

Exercise 1 - initialize_parameters
Create and initialize the parameters of the 2-layer neural network.

Instructions:

The model's structure is: LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID.
Use this random initialization for the weight matrices: np.random.randn(shape)*0.01 with the correct shape
Use zero initialization for the biases: np.zeros(shape)

b1 = [[0.]
 [0.]]
W2 = [[ 0.01744812 -0.00761207]]
b2 = [[0.]]

3.2 - L-layer Neural Network
The initialization for a deeper L-layer neural network is more complicated because there are many more weight matrices and bias vectors. When completing the initialize_parameters_deep function, you should make sure that your dimensions match between each layer. Recall that 𝑛[𝑙] is the number of units in layer 𝑙. For example, if the size of your input 𝑋 is (12288,209) (with 𝑚=209 examples) then:

Shape of W	Shape of b	Activation	Shape of Activation
Layer 1	(𝑛[1],12288)	(𝑛[1],1)	𝑍[1]=𝑊[1]𝑋+𝑏[1]	(𝑛[1],209)
Layer 2	(𝑛[2],𝑛[1])	(𝑛[2],1)	𝑍[2]=𝑊[2]𝐴[1]+𝑏[2]	(𝑛[2],209)
⋮	⋮	⋮	⋮	⋮
Layer L-1	(𝑛[𝐿−1],𝑛[𝐿−2])	(𝑛[𝐿−1],1)	𝑍[𝐿−1]=𝑊[𝐿−1]𝐴[𝐿−2]+𝑏[𝐿−1]	(𝑛[𝐿−1],209)
Layer L	(𝑛[𝐿],𝑛[𝐿−1])	(𝑛[𝐿],1)	𝑍[𝐿]=𝑊[𝐿]𝐴[𝐿−1]+𝑏[𝐿]	(𝑛[𝐿],209)
Remember that when you compute 𝑊𝑋+𝑏 in python, it carries out broadcasting. For example, if:

𝑊=𝑤00𝑤10𝑤20𝑤01𝑤11𝑤21𝑤02𝑤12𝑤22𝑋=𝑥00𝑥10𝑥20𝑥01𝑥11𝑥21𝑥02𝑥12𝑥22𝑏=𝑏0𝑏1𝑏2(2)
Then 𝑊𝑋+𝑏 will be:

𝑊𝑋+𝑏=(𝑤00𝑥00+𝑤01𝑥10+𝑤02𝑥20)+𝑏0(𝑤10𝑥00+𝑤11𝑥10+𝑤12𝑥20)+𝑏1(𝑤20𝑥00+𝑤21𝑥10+𝑤22𝑥20)+𝑏2(𝑤00𝑥01+𝑤01𝑥11+𝑤02𝑥21)+𝑏0(𝑤10𝑥01+𝑤11𝑥11+𝑤12𝑥21)+𝑏1(𝑤20𝑥01+𝑤21𝑥11+𝑤22𝑥21)+𝑏2⋯⋯⋯(3)

Exercise 2 - initialize_parameters_deep
Implement initialization for an L-layer Neural Network.

Instructions:

The model's structure is *[LINEAR -> RELU] × (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID*. I.e., it has 𝐿−1 layers using a ReLU activation function followed by an output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
Use random initialization for the weight matrices. Use np.random.randn(shape) * 0.01.
Use zeros initialization for the biases. Use np.zeros(shape).
You'll store 𝑛[𝑙], the number of units in different layers, in a variable layer_dims. For example, the layer_dims for last week's Planar Data classification model would have been [2,4,1]: There were two inputs, one hidden layer with 4 hidden units, and an output layer with 1 output unit. This means W1's shape was (4,2), b1 was (4,1), W2 was (1,4) and b2 was (1,1). Now you will generalize this to 𝐿 layers!
Here is the implementation for 𝐿=1 (one layer neural network). It should inspire you to implement the general case (L-layer neural network).
  if L == 1:
      parameters["W" + str(L)] = np.random.randn(layer_dims[1], layer_dims[0]) * 0.01
      parameters["b" + str(L)] = np.zeros((layer_dims[1], 1))

4 - Forward Propagation Module

4.1 - Linear Forward
Now that you have initialized your parameters, you can do the forward propagation module. Start by implementing some basic functions that you can use again later when implementing the model. Now, you'll complete three functions in this order:

LINEAR
LINEAR -> ACTIVATION where ACTIVATION will be either ReLU or Sigmoid.
[LINEAR -> RELU] × (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID (whole model)
The linear forward module (vectorized over all the examples) computes the following equations:

𝑍[𝑙]=𝑊[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]+𝑏[𝑙](4)
where 𝐴[0]=𝑋.


Exercise 3 - linear_forward
Build the linear part of forward propagation.

Reminder: The mathematical representation of this unit is 𝑍[𝑙]=𝑊[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]+𝑏[𝑙]. You may also find np.dot() useful. If your dimensions don't match, printing W.shape may help.

# GRADED FUNCTION: linear_forward

def linear_forward(A, W, b):
    """
    Implement the linear part of a layer's forward propagation.

print("Z = " + str(t_Z))
​
linear_forward_test(linear_forward)
Expected output

Z = [[ 3.26295337 -1.23429987]]

4.2 - Linear-Activation Forward
In this notebook, you will use two activation functions:

Sigmoid: 𝜎(𝑍)=𝜎(𝑊𝐴+𝑏)=11+𝑒−(𝑊𝐴+𝑏). You've been provided with the sigmoid function which returns two items: the activation value "a" and a "cache" that contains "Z" (it's what we will feed in to the corresponding backward function). To use it you could just call:

A, activation_cache = sigmoid(Z)
ReLU: The mathematical formula for ReLu is 𝐴=𝑅𝐸𝐿𝑈(𝑍)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑍). You've been provided with the relu function. This function returns two items: the activation value "A" and a "cache" that contains "Z" (it's what you'll feed in to the corresponding backward function). To use it you could just call:

A, activation_cache = relu(Z)
For added convenience, you're going to group two functions (Linear and Activation) into one function (LINEAR->ACTIVATION). Hence, you'll implement a function that does the LINEAR forward step, followed by an ACTIVATION forward step.


Exercise 4 - linear_activation_forward
Implement the forward propagation of the LINEAR->ACTIVATION layer. Mathematical relation is: 𝐴[𝑙]=𝑔(𝑍[𝑙])=𝑔(𝑊[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]+𝑏[𝑙]) where the activation "g" can be sigmoid() or relu(). Use linear_forward() and the correct activation function.

Expected output

With sigmoid: A = [[0.96890023 0.11013289]]
With ReLU: A = [[3.43896131 0.        ]]
Note: In deep learning, the "[LINEAR->ACTIVATION]" computation is counted as a single layer in the neural network, not two layers.


4.3 - L-Layer Model
For even more convenience when implementing the 𝐿-layer Neural Net, you will need a function that replicates the previous one (linear_activation_forward with RELU) 𝐿−1 times, then follows that with one linear_activation_forward with SIGMOID.


Figure 2 : *[LINEAR -> RELU] × (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID* model


Exercise 5 - L_model_forward
Implement the forward propagation of the above model.

Instructions: In the code below, the variable AL will denote 𝐴[𝐿]=𝜎(𝑍[𝐿])=𝜎(𝑊[𝐿]𝐴[𝐿−1]+𝑏[𝐿]). (This is sometimes also called Yhat, i.e., this is 𝑌̂ .)

Hints:

Use the functions you've previously written
Use a for loop to replicate [LINEAR->RELU] (L-1) times
Don't forget to keep track of the caches in the "caches" list. To add a new value c to a list, you can use list.append(c).

Awesome! You've implemented a full forward propagation that takes the input X and outputs a row vector 𝐴[𝐿] containing your predictions. It also records all intermediate values in "caches". Using 𝐴[𝐿], you can compute the cost of your predictions.


5 - Cost Function
Now you can implement forward and backward propagation! You need to compute the cost, in order to check whether your model is actually learning.


Exercise 6 - compute_cost
Compute the cross-entropy cost 𝐽, using the following formula:

Expected Output:

6 - Backward Propagation Module
Just as you did for the forward propagation, you'll implement helper functions for backpropagation. Remember that backpropagation is used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

Reminder:

Figure 3: Forward and Backward propagation for LINEAR->RELU->LINEAR->SIGMOID
The purple blocks represent the forward propagation, and the red blocks represent the backward propagation.
Now, similarly to forward propagation, you're going to build the backward propagation in three steps:

LINEAR backward
LINEAR -> ACTIVATION backward where ACTIVATION computes the derivative of either the ReLU or sigmoid activation
[LINEAR -> RELU] × (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID backward (whole model)
For the next exercise, you will need to remember that:

b is a matrix(np.ndarray) with 1 column and n rows, i.e: b = [[1.0], [2.0]] (remember that b is a constant)
np.sum performs a sum over the elements of a ndarray
axis=1 or axis=0 specify if the sum is carried out by rows or by columns respectively
keepdims specifies if the original dimensions of the matrix must be kept.
Look at the following example to clarify:
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
​
print('axis=1 and keepdims=True')
print(np.sum(A, axis=1, keepdims=True))
print('axis=1 and keepdims=False')
print(np.sum(A, axis=1, keepdims=False))
print('axis=0 and keepdims=True')
print(np.sum(A, axis=0, keepdims=True))
print('axis=0 and keepdims=False')

6.1 - Linear Backward
For layer 𝑙, the linear part is: 𝑍[𝑙]=𝑊[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]+𝑏[𝑙] (followed by an activation).

Suppose you have already calculated the derivative 𝑑𝑍[𝑙]=∂∂𝑍[𝑙]. You want to get (𝑑𝑊[𝑙],𝑑𝑏[𝑙],𝑑𝐴[𝑙−1]).


Figure 4
The three outputs (𝑑𝑊[𝑙],𝑑𝑏[𝑙],𝑑𝐴[𝑙−1]) are computed using the input 𝑑𝑍[𝑙].

Here are the formulas you need:
𝑑𝑊[𝑙]=∂∂𝑊[𝑙]=1𝑚𝑑𝑍[𝑙]𝐴[𝑙−1]𝑇(8)
𝑑𝑏[𝑙]=∂∂𝑏[𝑙]=1𝑚∑𝑖=1𝑚𝑑𝑍[𝑙](𝑖)(9)
𝑑𝐴[𝑙−1]=∂∂𝐴[𝑙−1]=𝑊[𝑙]𝑇𝑑𝑍[𝑙](10)
𝐴[𝑙−1]𝑇 is the transpose of 𝐴[𝑙−1].


Exercise 7 - linear_backward
Use the 3 formulas above to implement linear_backward().

Hint:

In numpy you can get the transpose of an ndarray A using A.T or A.transpose()

6.2 - Linear-Activation Backward
Next, you will create a function that merges the two helper functions: linear_backward and the backward step for the activation linear_activation_backward.

To help you implement linear_activation_backward, two backward functions have been provided:

sigmoid_backward: Implements the backward propagation for SIGMOID unit. You can call it as follows:
dZ = sigmoid_backward(dA, activation_cache)
relu_backward: Implements the backward propagation for RELU unit. You can call it as follows:
dZ = relu_backward(dA, activation_cache)
If 𝑔(.) is the activation function, sigmoid_backward and relu_backward compute
𝑑𝑍[𝑙]=𝑑𝐴[𝑙]∗𝑔′(𝑍[𝑙]).(11)

6.3 - L-Model Backward
Now you will implement the backward function for the whole network!

Recall that when you implemented the L_model_forward function, at each iteration, you stored a cache which contains (X,W,b, and z). In the back propagation module, you'll use those variables to compute the gradients. Therefore, in the L_model_backward function, you'll iterate through all the hidden layers backward, starting from layer 𝐿. On each step, you will use the cached values for layer 𝑙 to backpropagate through layer 𝑙. Figure 5 below shows the backward pass.


Figure 5: Backward pass
Initializing backpropagation:

To backpropagate through this network, you know that the output is: 𝐴[𝐿]=𝜎(𝑍[𝐿]). Your code thus needs to compute dAL =∂∂𝐴[𝐿]. To do so, use this formula (derived using calculus which, again, you don't need in-depth knowledge of!):

dAL = - (np.divide(Y, AL) - np.divide(1 - Y, 1 - AL)) # derivative of cost with respect to AL
You can then use this post-activation gradient dAL to keep going backward. As seen in Figure 5, you can now feed in dAL into the LINEAR->SIGMOID backward function you implemented (which will use the cached values stored by the L_model_forward function).

After that, you will have to use a for loop to iterate through all the other layers using the LINEAR->RELU backward function. You should store each dA, dW, and db in the grads dictionary. To do so, use this formula :

𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑠["𝑑𝑊"+𝑠𝑡𝑟(𝑙)]=𝑑𝑊[𝑙](15)
For example, for 𝑙=3 this would store 𝑑𝑊[𝑙] in grads["dW3"].


Exercise 9 - L_model_backward
